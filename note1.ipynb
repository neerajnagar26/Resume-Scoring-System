      "With a score of 78.5%, Neeraj's resume is strong and shows a good match for the Amazon Hiring Software Delivery (HSD) Team position. However, there are still areas for improvement to increase the score and make the resume stand out even more.\n",

      "**Detailed Feedback & Action Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Missing Skills & Gaps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Amazon specifically mentions the need for experience with AWS technologies like EC2, RDS/DynamoDB/RedShift. While Neeraj has a solid background in various programming languages and machine learning frameworks, there is no explicit mention of AWS experience. To address this gap, Neeraj should consider taking relevant AWS courses or obtaining certifications to demonstrate their proficiency in these technologies.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   - Familiarity with modern front-end technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Module Federation, React, and React Native is essential for this role. Although Neeraj has experience with Python, they should highlight any previous experience with the required front-end technologies or consider taking courses to gain the necessary skills.\n",

      "2. **Resume Strengths:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Neeraj's extensive experience in software engineering, particularly in the camera team at Samsung R&D, showcases their strong background in developing and optimizing software for various applications. This experience aligns well with the Amazon HSD Team's focus on creating innovative products.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Areas for Improvement:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Neeraj should emphasize their experience with AWS technologies and front-end development more explicitly in their resume, either in the \"Technical Skills\" section or by including relevant projects or work experience.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   - The \"Education\" section could be shortened to make room for more detailed descriptions of work experience and projects.\n",

      "5. **Final Recommendations:**\n",
